This is the time I telling you that that it’s forbidden 🚫 to use Json lock files or try get people to update  under them coincides..... 
They are not able to go back and make several changes before the lock files where commit.

But that will not be important any longer if this I write down under are clear to every human down here on this planet.

Because you apparently think it's okay to turn on "everything" ➰ down here.  ..

No...!  Because, that’s impossible for me to happened of course!, It’s is only so that first everyone who wants to decide completely wrong!  Fight for their lives on that matter ....
 And those who are unwilling to do so ..?  Lets get programmed right again.

Thank you in advance!
